# Bloom

Bloom is a remote trauma support service from Chayn, a global charity supporting survivors of abuse across borders. Bloom is our flagship product; a free, web-based support service designed for anyone who has experienced or is currently experiencing domestic or sexual abuse. Through a combination of online video-based courses, anonymous interaction and 1:1 chat, Bloom aims to provide tailored information, guidance, everyday tools, and comforting words to cope with traumatic events.

## Get involved

Bloom is created by Chayn, global nonprofit, run by survivors and allies from around the world, creating resources to support the healing of survivors of gender-based violence. There are lots of ways to get involved, from joining our volunteer team to [donating](https://www.paypal.me/chaynhq) or supporting us on social media.
